app1.selectiveadvertisinggroup.com  ‚Üí App 1 with its own branding
app2.selectiveadvertisinggroup.com  ‚Üí App 2 with its own branding
app3.selectiveadvertisinggroup.com  ‚Üí App 3 with its own branding
```

### Deployment Process
1. **Development**: Use selectiveadvertisinggroup.com subdomains
2. **Testing**: Test on selectiveadvertisinggroup.com
3. **Production**: Deploy to individual domain names when ready
